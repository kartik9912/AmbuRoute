ðŸš‘ AmbuRoute â€“ Emergency Ambulance Routing & Dispatch System
A console-based Java project that simulates an intelligent ambulance management and dispatch system. Built using core Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA), AmbuRoute handles patient and ambulance data, finds optimal routes, and simulates emergency dispatches.

ðŸ“Œ Features
ðŸ‘¤ Patient Registration: Add, view, update, and delete patient details.

ðŸš‘ Ambulance Management: Add and manage ambulance fleet with IDs, status, and location.

ðŸ§­ Optimal Routing: Find the shortest path to a hospital using Graphs (Dijkstra or BFS).

ðŸ“‹ Queue System: Prioritize critical patients with Queues.

ðŸ“š Search & Sort: Efficient data handling using Searching and Sorting algorithms.

ðŸ’» Fully console-based interface with intuitive menu-driven design.
